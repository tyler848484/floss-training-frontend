            I just finished my collegiate soccer career at the University of
            Dubuque, a Division 3 school in Dubuque, Iowa. I was a 3-year
            starter and 2-year captain, as well as a multi-year all-conference
            honorable mention player.
            <br />
            <br />
            At Carl Sandburg High School, I was a 2-year varsity starter,
            senior-year captain, and all-sectional player. The training I
            provide is fully catered to each player's needs. Being well-versed
            in many positions, I design drills and repetitions that reflect
            real-game scenarios.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my playing career, I've done extensive individual and
            small group training with teammates, giving me a wide variety of
            drills to help players sharpen their skills and elevate their game.
